## Problem

### Create table

Listen

Using a  **CREATE TABLE**  statement in SQL enables the creation of a new table in the database.
This statement can be used whenever a new table needs to be created, starting with a blank slate.
The example statement below demonstrates the creation of a new table called  **student**.

```
    CREATE TABLE student (
       Student_id INT,
       Student_Name  TEXT,
       Department  TEXT
   ); 

```

The above query will create an empty table 'student' as mentioned below:

 **Student_id** 	 **Student_Name** 	 **Department** 
		
		
### Task

Let us now try and build the table that we saw earlier, starting from scratch.
Write a query to create a table 'employee', with columns employee_id, employee_Name and Department.
Code it out in the IDE.
